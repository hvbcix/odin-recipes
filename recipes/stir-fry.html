    <p>Stir frying is a Chinese cooking technique in which ingredients are fried in a small amount of very hot oil while being stirred in a wok.</p>
    <p>I like to stir fry the vegetables that take a little longer to cook first. Like the carrots, mushrooms and baby corn. Then I add in the remainder ingredients. Broccoli, snow peas and the bell peppers do not take as long to cook.</p>
